For those of us who love to play video games, it can feel very isolating not being able to play with other people, so playing together in a competitive multiplayer game (Super Smash Brothers), learning about a new game and meeting new people is a great way to play, especially for grade 9's who are still a bit shy. A casual environment that the Smash club provides allows for less segregation between the grades, as it doesn't matter what your age or grade is when you're playing a game that all can enjoy. If there are enough people who participate, we plan on hosting tournaments in the name of friendly competition and cookies/baked goods (for participants).	http://i.imgur.com/BrJEi35.png		http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140512035133/earthboundla/es/images/a/a9/S%C3%ADmbolo_Smash.png
